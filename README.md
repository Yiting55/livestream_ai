# üé• Live Quality Analysis

A **Streamlit-based application** for analyzing and scoring livestream shopping videos.  
It evaluates **language quality (ASR + NLP)**, **visual scene quality (OpenCV + OCR)**, and **presenter emotion engagement (facial cues + speech)** to generate a **multi-dimensional livestream scorecard**.  

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Video Upload & Preview**: Upload `.mp4` / `.mov` videos directly in browser.  
- **Language Analysis**:
  - Accuracy (evidence-based claims)  
  - Clarity (speech rate, filler words)  
  - Persuasion (CTA and urgency usage)  
  - Interaction & pacing (questions, CTAs, replies, timeline)  
  - Compliance (exaggeration / risky terms)  
- **Scene Analysis** *(optional)*:
  - Brightness, saturation, contrast, sharpness  
  - OCR text extraction (on-screen content)  
  - Logo/brand detection for compliance  
- **Emotion Analysis** *(optional)*:
  - Valence (positivity of facial expressions)  
  - Energy (presenter engagement via movement and speech)  
- **Visualization**:
  - Metrics, radar charts, timelines, highlights, tag clouds  
- **Export**: Download structured JSON reports (with optional PDF reports)  
- **Temp File Management**: Uploaded files auto-deleted after analysis

##üìöTech Stack

Python 3.9+ / 3.10+
Streamlit ‚Äì interactive UI framework
faster-whisper / openai-whisper ‚Äì ASR (speech recognition)
OpenCV ‚Äì video frame processing (brightness, saturation)

##üö© Problem Addressed
Livestream e-commerce is expanding rapidly, but quality and compliance vary greatly.
This project provides an automated, objective scoring system to evaluate livestreams across multiple dimensions:
- Engagement (questions, CTAs, replies)
- Clarity (speech pace, filler words)
- Persuasion (CTA effectiveness, urgency framing)
- Compliance (avoid exaggerated claims)
- Visual quality (brightness, saturation, logos)
- Emotion (positivity and energy)
It enables sellers, reviewers, and brands to ensure livestreams are engaging, compliant, and effective.

##üì§ Output

The app produces structured results containing:
Scores (Accuracy, Clarity, Persuasion, Compliance, Interaction, Scene, Emotion)
Signals (WPM, filler rate, CTA hits, reply rate, exaggeration terms)
Visualisation charts
