# üé• **Livestream Quality Analysis**

A **Streamlit-based application** for analyzing and scoring livestream shopping videos.  
It evaluates **language quality (ASR + NLP)**, **visual scene quality (OpenCV + OCR)**, and **presenter emotion engagement (facial cues + speech)** to generate a **multi-dimensional livestream scorecard**.

---

## ‚ú® **Overview**

The **Livestream Quality Analysis System** is an automated tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into livestream content. It combines Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and emotion analysis to produce an objective, transparent scorecard for livestreams. The system evaluates multiple dimensions such as **engagement**, **clarity**, **persuasion**, **compliance**, **scene quality**, and **emotion** to help content creators, reviewers, and brands ensure their livestreams are effective, engaging, and aligned with brand standards.

## üöß **Challenges Addressed**

The rapid growth of **livestream e-commerce** presents several challenges:
1. **Ensuring Engagement**: Hosts must use effective CTAs, respond to audience questions, and maintain an interactive environment.
2. **Maintaining Clarity**: Speech must be fluent, well-paced, and free from excessive filler words.
3. **Demonstrating Persuasion**: Livestream hosts must employ urgency and effective language to drive sales.
4. **Guaranteeing Compliance**: Exaggerated claims, misleading statements, and violation of brand guidelines must be detected and flagged.
5. **Monitoring Visual Quality**: The video quality must meet certain standards, and brand logos should be properly displayed.

This tool provides automated solutions for assessing all these aspects using a combination of **ASR**, **NLP**, and **computer vision** technologies.
